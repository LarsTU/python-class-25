## Course: General info
This online course provides an introduction into Python for Bachelor and Master students at the University of Dortmund and introduces several tools to enable reproducible and reliable programming, including version control with git and collaborative programming via GitHub. By the end of the course, students should be capable of working on a project using Python and independently acquiring new Python knowledge.

+ Start Date: Thursday, August 22, 2024
+ End Date: Thursday, August 29, 2024
+ Time: 9:00-12:00 & 13:30-15/16:00 
+ Online Course: Zoom Link was provided in extra e-mail
+ Submission Project Work: September 30, 2024

## Final project
### Organisation of the project work:
+ project is done in groups of 2-3 people
+ you pick a topic that is of your interest (e.g., implementing an algorithm, analyzing and visualizing a data set, etc.)
+ as soon as you have group and topic, approach me that I can approve your choice
+ everyone should have a group and a topic until the end of December 2023
+ from next year on the weekly course sessions consist of independent group work
+ submission deadline of the project is September 30, 2024
+ project can be written in German or English
+ Further information (especially about grading) will follow in the next days
  
**Some ideas about possible projects:**
+ you can analyse a data set as part of your project incl. data wrangling, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, â€¦
+ data sets can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), furthermore some python libraries come already with data sets (e.g., [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html), [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data))
+ if you like problems apart from data analysis the website [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) has a whole archive with small problems.
+ another possibility is the selection of a particular algorithm in which you are interested in and implementing it, together with some visualizations (e.g., [EM-algorithm](https://github.com/Ransaka/GMM-from-scratch), Mixture Models, etc.)
